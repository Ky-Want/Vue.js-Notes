  <!-- What is Vue.js?
  Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building applications and websites 

  It provides tools out of the box to help make websites and apps faster and more dynamic
  It also gives a set of standards for code organization and expectations for individuals and teams that work in the same code base.

  If you've heard of a virtual DOM before, Vue.js is a virtual DOM framework. It's not too important at the moment, so don't worry if you don't know what that is. The virtual DOM basically makes JavaScript web applications a little bit faster and more efficient

  Vue by itself is extremely lightweight, you can get it down to about 8 or 10 kilobytes g zipped. Although, in a practical sense your Vue and bundled JavaScript will probably never be that small in an application. Although it is good to know that Vue doesn't have a lot of extra code taking up more space in your application. -->



  <!-- Why does Vue.js call itself a progressive framework?
    They use the term progressive to mean that you can use it anywhere from small features on websites where you want to add some interactivity and using it as a kind of a drop in replacement for JQuery and legacy applications, 
    all the way up to using it as a more full featured, batteries included, framework for large scale applications like Gmail or Twitter or things like that.
